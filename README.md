### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - CSS framework


### What I learned

I wanted to learn tailwindcss with this project and I definitely liked it. It helps you speed up in your work with build in classes but also difficult to debug with a lot of classes in your code.

### Continued development

I have to work more on JavaScript to improve my skills.
